Description: This package provides methods for simulating the evolution of 
  pathogen traits. The simulation method assumes
  a classical additive model for a trait in which the trait-value is formed as a 
  sum of single-locus and epistatic effects from the pathogen genotype, the host
  immune system type and a white noise term representing the combination of 
  unknown non-heritable factors such as unknown pathogen and host immune system
  loci, host environment and measurement error. It is assumed that the genotype
  of the pathogen can mutate during an infection as a result of neutral genetic
  drift or within-host selection for an optimal trait-value. At the between-host
  level various events, such as transmission to susceptible hosts, diagnosis and
  immunity are simulated according to a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) 
  epidemiological model. The rates at which these events occur as well as contact
  rates between infected and susceptible hosts can be specified as constants or
  as functions of the pathogen trait. The resulting epidemic is represented as
  a data.table and a rooted phylogenetic tree (a phylo object). The data 
  contains the history of within- and between- host events.
